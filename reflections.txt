How long did you spend working on this project?
	I would say I spent about 6 hours spread out over two days. 

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered? 
	The purchase feature is interesting because it causes objects from different classes to interact. I thought it was cool that the method that prevents a customer from purchasing an out-of-stock toy also works to prevent, in the event of and out-of-stock toy, any new transaction from being stored in the class variable or taking up an id. 

 What two additional features did you build? Why?
	Added the instance variables sales and revenue to Products, so that there is a tally of how many of each type of toy has sold and how much money they’ve brought in. I also put in the option of using a discount during a purchase, in which case the discount would be accounted for when calculating the revenue earned by that transaction. Finally I added to_s methods for Products, Customers, and Transactions, so that if you were to puts <product-object> you would actually see the name of the product etc.

Where do you still have room to grow?
	I wanted to make one of my Product methods private, which decreases the stock, and is used when there is a purchase. However, I needed to call it in a Transaction method, so it couldn’t be private. I was wondering about ways to get around this that I could use in the future, like requiring a password to be submitted as an argument before you can change the stock amount.
